# Battle of Nets
Battle of Nets is an experimental deep-learning project where cutting-edge models face off against eachother. Instead of relying on conventional benchmarks, we analyze how they process information—visually and structurally(The fun way!).

Join me on this self-learning journey to uncover algorithms and fun!
