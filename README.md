# <span style="color:#ff5733;">🔥 Battle of Nets 🔥</span>

**Battle of Nets** is an experimental deep-learning project where models compete in real-world tasks. We evaluate how they handle different challenges under different constraints.

Follow along as we learn and push these architectures to their limits.
