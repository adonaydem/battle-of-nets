**Battle of Nets** is an experimental deep-learning project where models compete in real-world tasks. We evaluate how they handle different challenges under different constraints.

Follow along as we learn and push these architectures to their limits.

## üîç <span style="color:#2ecc71;">Latest Results</span>  

### **First Results on Puzzle Solver Challenge**

The benchmarks for the Puzzle Solver Challenge are in! 
Robustness of models was analyzed against altered images using grid-based occlusion techniques. <a href="notebooks/PuzzleSolver_Occlusion/README.md">Description Link</a>


### **InceptionNet Joins the Battle**

A version inspired by *InceptionNet* was trained and quantized retaining **99.68%** of its original accuracy while achieving a **2.133x** speedup. *VGG19* previously led with a *2.168x* speedup and 99.46% accuracy, while ResNet20 held 99.74% accuracy but only improved speed by 1.2768x.

It's important to note ResNets still dominate in terms of sole speed, but are less affected by quantization.'

### **VGG19 vs ResNet20: Quantization Showdown**             

- **VGG19** retained **99.46%** of its original accuracy while achieving a **2.168x speedup**.  
- **ResNet20** held **99.74%** accuracy but only improved speed by **1.2768x**.  

With a stronger performance boost, **VGG19** leads as the first challenge winner in *Battle of Nets*. It's crucial to note that ResNet20 still is faster but less affected by quantization.
