# <span style="color:#ff5733;">🔥 Battle of Nets 🔥</span>

**Battle of Nets** is an experimental deep-learning project where models compete in real-world tasks. We evaluate how they handle different challenges under different constraints.

Follow along as we learn and push these architectures to their limits.

### **InceptionNet Joins the Battle**
***March 10, 2025***

A version inspired by **InceptionNet** was trained and quantized retaining **99.68%** of its original accuracy while achieving a **2.133x speedup**. VGG19 previously led with a 2.168x speedup and 99.46% accuracy, while ResNet20 held 99.74% accuracy but only improved speed by 1.2768x.

It's important to note ResNets still dominate in terms of sole speed, but are less affected by quantization.

### **VGG19 vs ResNet20: Quantization Showdown**                    
***January 25,2025***
- **VGG19** retained **99.46%** of its original accuracy while achieving a **2.168x speedup**.  
- **ResNet20** held **99.74%** accuracy but only improved speed by **1.2768x**.  

With a stronger performance boost, **VGG19** leads as the first challenge winner in *Battle of Nets*. It's crucial to note that ResNet20 still is faster but less affected by quantization.
